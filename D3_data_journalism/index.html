          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Lack of Healthcare Access and Poverty</h2>
          <p>The U.S. Census Bureau suggests that if a family's total income is less than the family's income threshold, 
            then that family and every individual in it is considered in poverty.  In short, a family of 4 with household 
            income less than $26,500 is considered living in poverty.</p>

          <p>There are far too many socioeconomic factors to explain why the states’ appear as they do on this plot, however,
             I outline a few observations: 
            
            <p>•	The New England states (Massachusetts (MA), New Hampshire (NH), Connecticut (CT), Rhode Island (RI), Vermont (VT), 
            and Maine (ME) appear to have low correlation between access to healthcare and poverty. Four of these states rank within 
            the top 10 most educated in the US. (www.wallethub.com) The higher the education level, the lower poverty level.</p>  
            <p>•	Conversely, Mississippi (MI) and Louisiana (LA) rank as two of the lowest educated states in the nation, thus proving 
            that their low education level leads to low poverty and thus lack of healthcare as seen in the higher x axis points on this plot.</p>
